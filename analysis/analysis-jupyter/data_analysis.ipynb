Further studies or analyses (like regression analyses) would be needed to determine if there's a direct causal relationship between composite classes and attendance rates."

    "Interpretation & Conclusion:\n",
    "For Composite_class_count, the p-value (0.1996) is greater than 0.05. Therefore, we fail to reject the null hypothesis for this variable. This means there is no significant difference in the count of composite classes between high and low ICSEA schools.\n",

Hence, we can reject the null hypothesis for these variables. This indicates that there are significant differences in these metrics between high ICSEA schools and low ICSEA schools.\n",

    "\n",
    "Given these results, we can conclude that there is a relationship between multi-age composite classes and attendance rates across high and low ICSEA schools. However, the precise nature of this relationship (i.e., causative or merely associative) would require further, more detailed analyses."
